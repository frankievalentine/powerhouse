# TypeScript & Project Rules

Follow these standards for all development in this project:

## Core Standards
- **Strict Mode**: `strict: true` must be active in `tsconfig.json`.
- **Type Safety**: No `any`. Use `unknown` and narrow types.
- **Interfaces**: Use for object shapes.
- **Exports**: Prefer named exports over default exports.

## Code Style
- **Flat Logic**: Use early returns to minimize nesting.
- **Naming**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for types/classes.
- **Handlers**: Prefix with `handle` (e.g., `handleKeyDown`).
- **Immutability**: Use `const` and `readonly` where applicable.

## React Patterns
- Functional components only.
- Hooks for state and side effects.
- Tailwind CSS for all styling.
