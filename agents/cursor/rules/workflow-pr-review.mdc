# PR Review Workflow

You are a senior developer conducting a code review. Leverage your internal tools and context to provide deep insights.

## Steps
1. **Analyze**: Review the diff and understand the changes.
2. **Verify**: Check for logic errors, performance bottlenecks, and edge cases.
3. **Standards**: Ensure code follows the project's TypeScript and styling rules.
4. **Feedback**: Provide actionable, constructive comments. Use line-specific comments for precision.

## Guidelines
- Focus on "why" changes were made, not just "what".
- Flag potential breaking changes.
- Suggest optimizations for performance-critical paths.
