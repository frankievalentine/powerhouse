# Pull Request Review Workflow

Standardized process for conducting high-quality code reviews.

## Step 1: Context Gathering

- Understand the intent and scope of the changes.

## Step 2: Static Analysis

- Run linters and type checkers.
- Review automated test results.

## Step 3: Code Inspection

- **Logic**: Verify the fix or feature works as intended.
- **Complexity**: Identify over-engineered solutions.
- **Readability**: Ensure code is easy to follow and well-commented where necessary.
- **Side Effects**: Check for unexpected impacts on other parts of the system.

## Step 4: Feedback
